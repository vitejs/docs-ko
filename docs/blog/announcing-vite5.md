We had the second edition of [ViteConf](https://viteconf.org/23/replay) a month ago, hosted by [StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com). Like last year, most of the projects in the ecosystem got together to share ideas and connect to keep expanding the commons. We're also seeing new pieces complement the meta-framework tool belt like [Volar](https://volarjs.dev/) and [Nitro](https://nitro.build/). The Rollup team released [Rollup 4](https://rollupjs.org) that same day, a tradition Lukas started last year.
