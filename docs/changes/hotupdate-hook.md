`hotUpdate` was first introduced in `v6.0`. The deprecation of `handleHotUpdate` is planned for a future major. We don't yet recommend moving away from `handleHotUpdate` yet. If you want to experiment and give us feedback, you can use the `future.removePluginHookHandleHotUpdate` to `"warn"` in your vite config.
