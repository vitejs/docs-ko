This test aims to check for a particular type of circular dependency that causes tricky deadlocks, **deadlocks with forked imports stack**
# Move to Per-environment APIs
:::info Release Candidate
The Environment API is generally in the release candidate phase. We'll maintain stability in the APIs between major releases to allow the ecosystem to experiment and build upon them. However, note that [some specific APIs](/changes/#considering) are still considered experimental.

We plan to stabilize these new APIs (with potential breaking changes) in a future major release once downstream projects have had time to experiment with the new features and validate them.

Vite 6 formalizes the concept of Environments. Until Vite 5, there were two implicit Environments (`client`, and optionally `ssr`). The new Environment API allows users and framework authors to create as many environments as needed to map the way their apps work in production. This new capability required a big internal refactoring, but a lot of effort has been placed on backward compatibility. The initial goal of Vite 6 is to move the ecosystem to the new major as smoothly as possible, delaying the adoption of the APIs until enough users have migrated and frameworks and plugin authors have validated the new design.

We had the second edition of [ViteConf](https://viteconf.org/23/replay) a month ago, hosted by [StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com). Like last year, most of the projects in the ecosystem got together to share ideas and connect to keep expanding the commons. We're also seeing new pieces complement the meta-framework tool belt like [Volar](https://volarjs.dev/) and [Nitro](https://nitro.build/). The Rollup team released [Rollup 4](https://rollupjs.org) that same day, a tradition Lukas started last year.

Even if `[X]` is imported by `[B]`, `[B]` is not in `[X]`'s stack because it's imported by `[H]` in first place then it's stack is only composed by `[H]`. `[H]` **forks** the imports **stack** and this makes it hard to be found.
    // "verbatimModuleSyntax": true from tsconfig.json should not be read
List of fields in `package.json` to try when resolving a package's entry point. Note this takes lower precedence than conditional exports resolved from the `exports` field: if an entry point is successfully resolved from `exports`, the main field will be ignored. This setting only affects non-externalized dependencies.
